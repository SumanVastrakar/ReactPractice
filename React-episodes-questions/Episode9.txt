⭕️ What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples?
✅ 1. Image Tag (HTML):
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description">

2. CSS Background Image:
.element-with-background {
    background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg');
}

5. Local Storage (React Native):
import React from 'react';
import { View, Image } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <View>
            <Image source={require('./path/to/image.jpg')} />
        </View>
    );
};

export default App;

⭕️ What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
✅

⭕️ How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ? 
✅ When you use the useEffect hook in React without specifying a dependency array, the effect will
run after every render. This means the effect will run on the initial render and every subsequent 
re-render, regardless of changes to any dependencies. It's equivalent to not having a dependency
array at all.

⭕️ What is SPA?
✅ SPA stands for Single Page Application. It's a web application or website that interacts with the
user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server.
In other words, in a SPA, the entire application is contained within a single HTML page, and the
content is updated dynamically as the user interacts with the application.

⭕️ What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
✅ Client-Side Routing:
The routing logic is handled on the client side, within the web browser.
Page changes and transitions are managed by JavaScript running in the browser.
Typically used in Single Page Applications (SPAs) where the entire application is loaded on the initial page load, and subsequent page changes are handled dynamically.

Server-Side Routing:
The routing logic is handled on the server.
Each user interaction triggers a request to the server, which then sends back the appropriate HTML for the requested page.
Traditional multi-page applications often use server-side routing.
