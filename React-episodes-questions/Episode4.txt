‚≠ïÔ∏è What is JSX?
‚úÖ JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript that is
commonly used with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
JSX allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files, making it easier
to define the structure of UI components.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Superpowers of JSX?
‚úÖ  Readability and Conciseness:
JSX syntax resembles HTML, making the code more readable and intuitive.
It provides a concise and expressive way to define the structure of UI components,
making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.

JavaScript Integration:
JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} directly in the markup.
This makes it easy to include dynamic values, variables, and expressions directly
within the JSX code.
üåº const name = "World";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;

Components and Reusability:
JSX promotes the creation of reusable and modular components. Components can be
composed together, and the syntax for rendering components within other components
is straightforward.

Inline Styles and CSS Classes:
JSX allows the use of inline styles directly within the components,
providing a convenient way to style elements. Additionally, CSS classes
can be applied using the className attribute.

‚≠ïÔ∏è {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
‚úÖ 
{TitleComponent}:
This is used when you want to reference a component or a variable within the JSX.
It assumes that TitleComponent is a variable or a component previously defined in your 
code. In this case, it won't render the component but rather the reference to it, and 
you'll need to make sure to use it as a JSX element, like {<TitleComponent />},
to actually render it.

{<TitleComponent/>}:
This syntax is used to directly render the TitleComponent. It treats TitleComponent as a
React element and renders it in place. This is the most common way to render components in JSX.

{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}:
This is an alternative syntax to render the TitleComponent. It's equivalent to
{<TitleComponent />}, and you can use either form based on your preference.
